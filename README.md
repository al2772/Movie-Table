# Movie-Table
Takes in a table with movies and information in csv format. Then outputs a properly formatted table displaying these movies. Done in C code without using string.h to format text. My work was done in the file "student_functions.c"

To compile:

Run "make" that builds student_functions.c

To execute:

Run "./Print_Table > myoutput1.txt" where myoutput1.txt can be any named text file, myoutput1.txt is used for this example
